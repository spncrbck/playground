# Projects

This repository is for my personal projects as I learn more about software development. While this current repository is somewhat empty, I am working on adding projects from years-past and adding current working projects.

### Development Environment

Currently, I am using two forms of development environments; [Atom](https://atom.io/) on W10 with GitHub integration and SSH connection to Raspberry Pi (via [PuTTy](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)) + VIM + command-line git committing/pushing.

### Future Project Plans

* Data analytics -- 'projects' are TBD
* 3D visualization of flights on a globe -- email and web scraping / data fetching
* More physics-based calculators/simulations
* Encryption/decryption tools
* Price-tracking web scraper and comparator
* Raspberry Pi -- network-wide advertisement blocker
